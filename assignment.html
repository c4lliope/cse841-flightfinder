<h2>Part  1 Text Problem 2.10: (Total 60 points. Programming: 50 points; 5 conceptual questions: 10 points)</h2>     
The map shown below is marked with 60 cities in the contiguous states of US.         
Given any two cities, you need to compute the least cost path between them.         
Implement the A* algorithm to compute the least cost path.<br>        
&nbsp;
<table BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5" COLS="2" WIDTH="95%" NOSAVE>
  <caption>¡¡</caption>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><br>
  </tbody>
  <tr NOSAVE>
    <td NOSAVE>
      <ul>
        <li>The map is given just for your reference. It is not required in your     
          program.</li>
        <li>The list of all the cities shown in the map is given <a href="cities">here</a>.  
          The coordinates given along with the cities are the x (horizontal) and  
          y (vertical) distances from the top left corner. Multiply this  
          distance by 4 to get the distance in miles.</li> 
        <li>The cost of the flight ticket between any two cities is given in  
          this <a href="flightCharges">table</a>.  
          This is a 60x60 matrix and a value of 393 at position (1,2) indicates  
          that the flight ticket from city 1 to city 2 costs $393. A `0' entry  
          in the table denotes that there is no direct flight between the two  
          cities.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The cities marked with an asterisk (*) in the city list are assumed to be hubs 
of airlines. In addition to the cost of the flight ticket, you encounter a cost 
for the time you spend for the travel. Use the following information to compute 
the time taken for your trip.
<ul>
  <li>Assume the cruising speed of the airplane to be 450 miles per hour and 
    allow 20 minutes for take-off and landing while computing the 
    terminal-to-terminal time.</li>
  <li>Assume the waiting time for a connection (or connection time) to be:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1 hour for flights between two hub cities.</li>
    <li>2 hours for flights between a hub city and a non-hub city.</li>
    <li>3 hours for flights between two non-hub cities.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Assume your time is worth <i>$<b>x</b></i> an hour. Your program should 
    take this value as a command line argument.</li>
</ul>
<u>Input to the program</u>:
<p>Your Linux program should use the syntax:<br>
  <strong>findRoute start_city end_city cost_of_hour</strong><br>
  <br>
  If you use Matlab function, use the syntax <br>
  <strong>findRoute(start_city, end_city, cost_of_hour)</strong><br>
  <br>
  where start_city and end_city are the integer codes of the cities and cost_of_hour is in dollars. Your program    
should be named '<b>findRoute</b>'. 
<p>For example, to run the     
  program, one should be able to do: <br>
  <b>findRoute&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 36&nbsp; 12.5</b>,     
  <br>
  where <b>0</b> is the origin city (Albany, NY), <b>36</b> is the destination     
  city (Miami, FL), and your time is worth <b>$12.5</b> per hour. Note that the     
  cities should be numbered 0 through 59.    
<p>If you use Matlab, name your program findRoute.mat. I should be able to load your findRoute.mat and run <b>findRoute(0, 36, 12.5</b>) in the Matlab command window.
<p><u>Output from the program</u>:
<p>Your program should compute the least cost path (not the shortest or fastest) 
from the origin to destination and output each of the legs of the route, with 
the start and end times (terminal times) and the cost incurred for the leg 
(include the connection time at the starting airport of the leg while computing 
the cost). The output format of your program should be as follows:
<p>&gt; <b>findRoute&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 36&nbsp; 12.5</b>    
<ol>
  <li>Albany(NY)&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Boston(MA)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0:00&nbsp; 
    0:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $85.35</li>   
  <li>Boston(MA)&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Atlanta(GA)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:55&nbsp; 5:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    $245.40</li>   
  <li>Atlanta(GA)&nbsp; -&nbsp; Miami(FL)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:40&nbsp; 
    8:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $120.50</li>   
</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Cost:&nbsp; $451.25        
<p>&gt;
<blockquote>
  <p><u>Notes:</u>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>The output shown is not the actual result of the search. It is provided 
    only to illustrate the <i>format</i> of the output.</li>
  <li>The start and end times of each leg denote the departure and arrival times 
    at the terminals. The connection time for the next flight should be used to 
    compute the departure time of the next leg.</li>
  <li>The cost of a leg includes the flight charges and the time spent in 
    waiting for the flight and the terminal to terminal time of the flight.</li>
</ul>
<u>The heuristic function, h(n)</u>:
<p>Use the following heuristic function for your program.
<ul>
  <li>h(n) = Distance <font face="Arial Narrow">x</font> least cost-per-mile + 
    time cost <font face="Arial Narrow">x</font> (flight time + waiting time).</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Distance = Euclidean distance between n and destination * 4. (to convert 
    to miles).</li>
  <li><i>Least cost per mile</i> = <b>Min</b>(Flight-cost/Distance) over all 
    city pairs in the 60x60 table. Note that this quantity is a constant and can 
    be computed even before you write your program.</li>
  <li>F<i>light time</i> = (distance / cruising speed) + take-off and landing 
    time.</li>
  <li><i>Waiting time</i>: depends in type of origin city (n) and destination 
    city of the flight.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Grading Notes:</u></b>

<h2><u>FAQs</u></h2>
<b>1.</b> What does the word 'destination' in the heuristics  refer to?         
The final destination or the destination of the next flight?        
<blockquote>
  <b><i>Ans</i></b>: h(n) is supposed to be an optimistic estimate of the 
  distance or cost to the goal state (or final destination). So it is not 
  advisable to use the distance to the next city here.
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>2.</b> 'Least cost per mile = Min(Flight-cost/Distance) over all city pairs 
in the 60x60 table. Note that this quantity is a constant and can be computed 
even before you write your program.' Does this mean the the cheapest flight in 
dollars/mile of all the flights and there is only 1? Or does it mean the 
cheapest destination for each flight, meaning there will be one for each city?
<blockquote>
  <b><i>Ans</i></b>: It is over all the flights and you will get a single value 
  for the whole table. Do think about what we are trying to achieve with this 
  measure.
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>3.</b> The question says `allow 20 minutes for take-off and landing'. Is this 
a total of 20 minutes or 20 minutes each?
<blockquote>
  <b><i>Ans</i></b>: It is a total of 20 minutes (10 + 10).
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>4.</b> In the Heuristic, Flight time is defined as &quot;(distance / cruising 
speed) + take-off and landing time&quot;. Now, does this distance mean the 
straight line distance between 2 cities even if there is no flight between them? 
Or do I need to make a special accommodation in the case of no direct flight?
<blockquote>
  <b><i>Ans</i></b>: Yes, it is the straight-line distance even if there is no 
  direct flight between them. It is an optimistic estimate. One can definitely 
  think of more complicated heuristics which better reflects the actual lowest 
  cost. The heuristic given was made simple to make the programming easier.
